# Matrix Capsules with EM Routing ODE-based Variant.

This is the next step of my experiment. The hypothesis is to determine if there is a viable solution to express the training algorithm as an ODE function. If it is possible, we can use ODE solvers to make the training MANY times slower. The training algorithm as described in the paper is the largest constraint given it cannot be paralleled across GPU's because the capsule's depend on each other. 

Current bug is dealing with an issue where after running it through once, the output of the function which will be the input when the ODE solver iterates again is 2 less than what it needs to be. This is an issue with padding since capsules are just convolutions on different dimensions of a single feature map. What needs to happen is to bad the capsule layers so it has two extra capsules. I am currently not sure what these are going to be or if it even has any significant. Pad with empty capsules or pad with the mean of the localized capsules. Exploring options right now.
